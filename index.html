                <p  style="text-indent: 1em;"> Hi! Welcome and thank you for passing by! I hope you enjoy my work. It doesn't look like much for the moment but it will grow in time, I promise. Meanwhile, why don't you play some <a href="snake.html">Snake</a> for a while, or even better, learn some <a href="algorithms.html">Algorithms</a> <i>(I would recommend QuickSort, because it is just so cool.)</i> Also, I have prepared a list of <a href="links.html">Useful Resources</a>. I know the internet is full of them, but finding good quality tutorials is really hard, so enjoy the one's I have <cite>hand(mouse)</cite>-picked.<br></p><p  style="text-indent: 1em;"> The journey you are about to start will be long, full of joy and disappointment, full of discovery, creation, innovation and most important, learning. There is no space for giving up, or going back. Once you are in, you can of course back down, but this would mean you were never actually in. Because if you code, you code for life. By the way, this might be a good time to tell you that this page is about coding. But coders can't write plain English, so excuse the lack of content of these words. If you get something from them, I'm happy, but if not, go ahead and explore the rest of the pages, because pictures and videos and links are much cooler than these weird black signs. 
                <p  style="text-indent:1em;">Now take a step back and appreciate the fact that we can communicate in such a special way, for <em>it is</em> special and <em>it is</em> ours to appreciate. And one more thing: do not overlook the great level of liberty you get, the kind of liberty you will seek like an addict for the rest of your living days. No limits for where you can go. One might argue with the previous statement, saying that there is a limited amount of task a computer achieve. This migh be true on a conceptual level, but imagine this: you have the letters. Oh, writing, how I missed you.<em>I missed you like I missed sun in Scotland.</em> </p>
                    <p  style="text-indent: 3em; font-weight:bold;">Enjoy your visit!
